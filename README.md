# Machine_Learning_Project_2020

In this R Project, we will learn how to perform detection of credit cards.This is a common type of fraud and credit cards numbers for illegal transactions.

For dealing with unbalanced data there are two techniques such as, #Random oversampling and #Random undersampling

#Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique(SMOTE)

#Accuracy Level = 0.9992

#Using Shiny App to develop application for the model
